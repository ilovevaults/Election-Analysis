# Election-Analysis
## Goals
  The first goal of this analysis was to determine which candidate had the most amount of votes and which county hard the largest voter turn out. The data that was used came from a CSV file that contained ballot ID, candidate's name, and county. The second goal was to create a script that can be used in other elections to determine the winner and highest turn out by county.

#### Election Audit Summary
This script can be used to determine the winner of any election and can even determine which state, county, or group of people had the highest turnout
during the election. This script can be modified for a presidential election which will determine who won the election and the percentage of Democrats or Republicans who voted. Another way this script can be modified could be for food companies to determine which flavor is the best and possibly also determine which age group voted the most.
